    "Welcome! You may be wondering what this is, and where you are. This is a collection of materials for learning introductory \"data science\" concepts from the comfort of your web browser. Before we talk about the environment (the windows, tabs, and buttons you see), let's first give an overview of what these materials will eventually cover:\n",

    "1. **The Linux command-line** - the command-line is an incredibly powerful interface for working with data and software, and it frequently serves as common 'glue' that pulls other data science tools together.\n",

    "One thing you'll eventually notice is that each notebook is associated with a \"kernel\" - a term associated with Jupyter Notebooks that refers to a behind-the-scenes program that can run code embedded within the notebook itself. This notebook is running the `Python 3` kernel (indicated by \"Python 3\" in the upper-right corner of the notebook tab). To interact with the kernel, try clicking on the code cell below and then click the \"play\" button near the top of the notebook. "

Try closing the `test_open.ipynb` tab and then shutting down the associated kernel. \n",
